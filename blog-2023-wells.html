              <p>Before I dive into the adventures I had in May after I finished exams, I need to catch y'all up on a few things!<br>I got a summer gig from June 12th until early August working for <a href="https://www.apogeeadventures.com/" target="_blank">Apogee Adventures</a>! They take kids ages 11-18 on exciting outdoors trips all over the world with a big focus on community-driven growth. I'll be working in their office in Brunswick, Maine helping to enable their trips in the Northeast US, so I'll be doing a little bit of everything!<br>Since my start date was for a month after exams ended, I figured I would road trip my way up in Wells (his first big trip!) and climb in all the great areas the Northeast has that I haven't gotten to visit yet. I even roped in my friend Abby to come join me!<br>So, with a dedicated belay, lots of stoke, and a month of free time, I ended exams with a lot of energy ready to expend itself...</p>

              </div>
              <p>The first leg of my journey was to zoom over to this wilderness area just near the NC/TN border to take Chiquita (my packraft) down the Nolichucky river with my friend James, a raft guide. We didn't do a SUPER job planning things out, we pretty much just agreed to camp out in that area that night, so I arrived at around noon, let James know where I set up, then proceeded to hang around, bored as all get-out for 8 hours until he arrived.<br>It was awesome.<br>I had been so busy with school and adventuring and all manner of hobbies that I really couldn't remember the last time I just sat aroud and did nothing. I hung around Wells, tidied up, read my book (Marriage and Morals by Burtrand Russell), wandered about the forest near the camp spot, or just watched the clouds float by. It was incredibly cathartic!<br>James arrived just at dusk, we cooked some dinner together and chatted before hitting the sack for our big day to come.<br>I'm going to leave y'all on that cliff hanger because the story of rafting the Nolichucky is more a part of a different venture that has yet to be completed, but I'll be making that post eventually! You'll know it when you see it ;)<br>Anyway, after our adventure on the Nolichucky, I made a beeline for Table Rock at Linville Gorge to climb for a few days with my best friend, Phil.<br>We ALSO did not do a super job of coordinating, and I spent the night alone at the Table Rock parking lot after rafting, then Phil arrived the next evening. Once again, I was left burning most of the day on whichever tasks I could find for myself, and, once again, I LOVED it!<br>Once Phil arrived we came up with our plan: Climb a small climb with what time we had left before the darkness and rain came for us that day, then the following day do something a bit bigger!<br>We tackled Lightning Crack on Table Rock, something I've had my eye on for a while and it did not disappoint! It went seamlessly: We found it with no issues, nobody fell or got gear stuck and we flowed up it pretty quickly. Plus, about two minutes after we returned to the parking lot it started DUMPING rain, so we even timed the whole thing perfectly!<br>The next day we arose early to take a crack at climbing The Daddy, a ~4 pitch 5.6 in The Amphitheater of Linville Gorge. It's well known to be one of the top classics in all of NC, and I'd been wanting to climb it ever since I started trad climbing years ago!</p>

                <p>I raft my first class IV rapids, do a climb I've had on my to-do list for years, push myself at Seneca Rocks, present a poster at a conference in Washington DC, and climb in a lot of places across the Northeast including Great Falls NP, The Gunks, The Adirondacks, and Acadia NP.</p>
