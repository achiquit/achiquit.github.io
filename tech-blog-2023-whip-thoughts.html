              <p class="blog-post">As I sit here in my van, tucked away in a dead-end street refuge in a ritzy neighborhood for the night, the only evidence of my big fall is a sore spot on my tailbone, but I know I was lucky. As I do a mental systems check, I feel fine. However, one of my good friends recommended that I write down my thoughts and feelings about what happened to help process and ensure I can get back in the saddle well. I'm sure you're curious what happened, so before I get to the journaling, here it is!<br>I was on a two-day trip to a single pitch sport and trad crag to Sauratown in the Piedmont of NC with the UNC climbing club. I hadn't really been planning to put climbs away left and right, as the main idea behind the trip was to take newer people out, but I did hope to get on a couple hard things, as I haven't gotten the chance to climb at Sauratown much. The first day was going really well; we set up at an area called The Beach and/or Party Ledge (depending on who you ask), and we got ropes up on a variety of grades so everyone was clambering around, having fun, and basking in the sun. After getting some more moderate routes set up with a top rope, I set my eyes on a cool 5.10d sport route. It was a 70ft route that went up a technical, crimpy face to an overhang, where a series of big holds led to a second overhang known to be somewhat cryptic. I gave it my best, and pulled off an onsight<sup>1</sup>!<br>I was pretty chuffed, and soon set my sights on the next hardest climb in the vacinity: a 5.11d mixed<sup>2</sup> climb up an arete. I'm not a 5.11d onsight climber, so I was under no illusions that I would be falling. The climb went up the arete through three bolts to a good ledge, then pulled a roof protected by gear, then more gear protection for another 20 or so feet to the anchors. I took a look and saw that the bolted section was fairly well protected, and figured I could bring plenty of cams to make sure I could adequately protect the upper section after the bolts. I rocked up, and the climb sure was 5.11. I took a fall on the second bolt and was thankful that my belayer, who was 15 or so pounds lighter than me, had a backup belayer who helped weigh her down, as it was a big one. That first fall was maybe 10-15 feet, which wasn't so bad.<br>I kept at it and soon found myself on the ledge, scrunched under the roof I would soon have to pull. I placed two cams at the edge of the ledge near the roof (a slightly overcammed .4 and a solid .3, both connected to the same quickdraw), and prepared to make my move.<br>That was where I found the crux.<br>I had a really solid hold just at the roof to pull on, but everything on the face above was shit. While hanging from the good hold at the edge of the roof I was already about a foot above my cams. I hemmed and hawed quite a bit, climbing up to just under the face and feeling around, thinking about it, trying holds out right, trying some out left, and nothing felt great. I would return to the ledge and sit down to rest up, but eventually I knew I had to at least try something. I decided to go for it with the holds out left, which seemed like a better sequence than the garbage I found to the right. I did my best with the tiny, slopey crimps, but pitched off when I threw for what I knew would be a jug. At this point I was probably 5 feet above my little nest of cams, and offset to the left a bit. I plunged downwards, and as the rope became taught and I started getting pulled to the right (because I was to the left of my gear), I must have caught the arete with my leg, as I flipped upside-down and cartwheeled across the face and gave the rock to the right of my swing a little love-tap with my tailbone. I righted myself, got my feet on the rock, made sure my belayer knew I was alright, and pulled back up to the ledge. Never have I been so happy I was wearing a helmet. Even though I didn't hit my head, I had such a helpless feeling while spinning through the air, knowing that I was wearing a helmet was my one comfort in that moment.<br>After steadying myself, I actually found a gear placement I had missed smack-dab in the middle of the roof I needed to pull. It was an unlikely looking placement, as it was between two maybe inch thick shelves of rock, but they were clearly bullet-hard and very strong. I placed a cam there, and proceeded to fall on it twice while owrking the same move. Eventually I made it to the top and all was well, but man, it was a wild ride.</p>

              <p class="blog-post after-img">So, with that out of the way, on to the journaling!<br>I honestly didn't feel too shaken up immediately after the fall, and the following day I climbed pretty well. As I mentioned, I really liked that I wore my helmet, and that experience affirmed my 'always wear your helmet' attitude. Looking at the climb, I never would have thought there was a good chance of going inverted, but yet there I went! I also liked that I had a lot of faith in the gear that caught my fall. When I was placing it, the .4 didn't quite satisfy me, so placing that second cam gave me a lot more confidence that at least one of them had me.<br>I think the take-home lesson I got from the experience was to be more discerning with gear placements. I didn't need to be as run-out as I was on my first try, when I took the really big fall. The cam I placed aftewards was not THAT hard to find, I just used the placements I had and moved on up. I think I was also a little too comfortable with the "run it out until you find another really good stance" mentality. That's a really stupid way to climb, and it ended with me cartwheeling across a cliff-face upside-down.<br>In the future, especially with harder leads, I need to be more demanding with how I protect them. I shouldn't settle for "that'll do," especially when I climbing at my limit.<br>And I need to make sure I keep wearing my helmet!</p>
