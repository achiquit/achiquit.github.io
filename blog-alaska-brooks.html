              <p>Our first day of the trip, getting from Durham to Fairbanks and gathering the final supplies we needed, would be a big one. It started at 3am EST, and ended at about 9pm AKDT, meaning we had a 28-hour day to work with after the time zone changes, plus the high latitude at Fairbanks meant the sun never truly set. The closest we got to night was a 2-hour dusk-like period at around 2am or so.</p>
              <p>The flights were uneventful save for my discovery that Wrath of Man, the new Jason Statham movie, can be enjoyed and understood easily without audio, as I had not brought any headphones on the plane to watch the in-flight movies.</p>
              <p>The real meat of the day began after arriving in Fairbanks. Once we landed, we took a Lyft to the local REI to pick up the bear spray and camp stove fuel Kelly had ordered ahead of time. The preorder was due to flight regulations barring possession or checking of compressed stuff. After getting our paws on the fuel and spray, we made our way to Sven’s Basecamp Hostel where we would spend the night before heading up to Coldfoot in the Arctic Circle the following day.</p>
              <p>But wait, you didn’t think we were done with errands, did you?</p>
              <p>We still had one more flight left to get to Coldfoot aboard a charter plane, which wouldn’t allow us to bring our stove fuel due to the afore-mentioned regulations. After settling in at Sven’s, Kelly and I took a 2 mile walk back to the airport to get our fuel on an overnight bus destined for Coldfoot, then on the way back we stopped at the grocery store for some much-needed booze.</p>
              <p>After finally making it back to Sven’s, filling up the flask with rum (this is how I learned one should always fill a flask with whiskey or something else strong), and downing the rest of the rum mixed with orange juice, we finally settled in on the root covered, $24 patch of dirt for the night.</p>

              <p>Day number two of travel, and it would be a big one! After some in and out sleep, we were up at 6am to catch our charter plane to Coldfoot. The plane felt like something out of Indiana Jones. The back half was empty boards with runners and a palette of goods, with seats in the front half for me, Kelly, and two other lone passengers. The pilot was a very tall, spindly man Kelly and I dubbed Kurt, simply because that seemed a fitting name for him.</p>

              <p style="padding-top: 25px;">The flight from Fairbanks to Coldfoot had so many beautiful views, I’ll let them speak for themselves!</p>

              </div>
              <p style="padding-top: 25px;">Our arrival would precede that of our camp stove fuel, so we hiked perhaps an eighth of a mile from the airstrip to Coldfoot, a truckstop with a restaurant, a hotel made from trailers, and the last chance for gas until Deadhorse some 240 miles north along the Dalton Highway, where our fuel would be delivered. There we had two enormous burgers and fries and sipped at some beers until the fuel set us free.</p>

              </div>
              <p style="padding-top: 25px;">After making sure we had everything, we went back to the highway to attempt to hitch a ride 130 miles north to where we would finally begin our trek at the Ribdon River. </p>
              <p>And there we waited.</p>
              <p>For about two hours, we laid about in the sun, dancing around in the road, doing yoga poses, and humming tunelessly in between holding our thumbs out for semis and working trucks that blasted by us along with a fine coating of dust.</p>
              <div style="border-style:double;">

              </div>
              <p style="padding-top: 25px;">After we got tired of lying about, we just decided to start walking for something to do. We made it at most two miles before we were finally picked up by two caribou hunters, a father and son. After loading our gear into the bed of their pickup and hopping in ourselves, we were off!</p>
              <p>The ride was quite varied. After around 10 or 20 miles, the highway turned from asphalt to dirt/gravel, which made our ride a bit rougher and punctuated with rocks kicking up and hitting the underside of the bed. The views along the ride were spectacular, with stunning mountains and streams rolling past. Eventually the road took us to Atigun Pass, the highest mountain pass of any highway in the US. Up there it got misty, drizzly, and cold. I had started the ride in shorts and a t-shirt and Kelly had started in shorts and a tank, but by the time we hit Atigun Pass we were both bundled up soundly in long sleeves, long pants, buffs, and rain gear to stay warm and dry!</p>
              <p>In the high mountains of the pass, we were lucky enough to see dall sheep poking around the cliffs, then several miles down from the pass the hunters pulled over to point out a grizzly bear meandering about the Sag River! This was the first grizzly Kelly or I had ever seen, and a good reminder of how wild an area we were going into. After leaving the mountains and hitting the tundra we had a more level ride and got to see a snowy owl swoop across the highway and across the landscape!</p>

              </div>
              <p style="padding-top: 25px;">Once reaching our innocuous starting point, we banged on the side of the truck to signal our new friends to stop. We chatted briefly while getting geared up for the short walk to the river, and we were gifted with some bug spray for the trip. We hadn’t brought any, as we were banking on dressing to avoid bugs and hoping we wouldn’t need spray.</p>
              <p>Boy, were we glad to have that spray later!</p>
              <p>After saying our goodbyes and giving our thanks, we hoofed it across the tundra through soggy moss and low brush towards the Sag River.</p>
              <p>We planned to ford all the way to the other side, make camp, then begin hiking up the Ribdon River on its north side.</p>
              <p>We made it halfway across the Sag to a rocky island before deciding it would be safer to ford using our rafts rather than walking. The water had reached slightly above our waists and was moving fast, making it very risky, even with two trekking poles each.</p>
              <p>By this time, it was already 10pm, so we decided to just make camp where we were and finish fording the next morning.</p>

              <p>The following morning, our first order of business (after breaking camp, of course) was floating the rest of the river. It was somewhat anti-climactic, as the actual rafting took us one third of the time setting up and breaking down our rafts took, but it was worth it for the safety!</p>

              <p style="padding-top: 25px;">Our hike began with cutting over a hill to reach the Ribdon River, to then follow it upstream into the Brooks Range. The beginning of the day was rough for mosquitoes, but we applied our gifted bug spray at our first break an hour or two in and had instant relief.</p>
              <p>The day was relatively uneventful compared to days past and days to come, but we did see some neat wildlife, including two herds of musk oxen, a gopher, and a lone, shockingly white seagull.</p>
              <p>I’ll let the pictures of the day speak for themselves!</p>

              <p>Day 2 started mistily moody as all get-out, making for a spooky early morning bathroom break. However, after getting started the mist quickly evaporated in the sun, leading to another beautiful day!</p>
              <p>We spent the day following game trails through the thick brush. They can be hard to follow as they fade in and out, so we were constantly switching from smooth going on a game trail, to trying to keep track of where it was, to crashing through underbrush.</p>

              <p style="padding-top:25px;">During our times on the river bar rather than the tundra we were seeing increasingly fresh moose prints in the mud, and eventually saw the culprit several hundred yards ahead in our path. He saw us as well and beat it to the river, much to our relief, never to be seen again (moose are known to be grumpy).</p>
              <p>We also saw large amounts of bear scat, but luckily no bear to go along with it!</p>

              <p style="padding-top:25px;">Towards the end of the day, we crossed a marsh near the river, and both Kelly and I had a similarly interesting experience! As we picked our way across the marsh, we occasionally noticed the iridescent rainbow of oil leaking into the water, and we both had the knee-jerk reaction of “ugh, pollution. Come on, humanity,” before realizing that it was natural!</p>
              <p>What we were seeing was the exact reason we watch 120 miles of oil pipeline on the way up, the natural oil just seeping out of the ground. It was an interesting experience to notice our own biases and caused us to think deeply about the oil mining in such a beautiful, pristine place.</p>

              </div>
              <p style="padding-top:25px;">We made camp on the edge of a hill for high ground most of the way through the marsh, nice and sheltered from the wind. Dinner that night was dehydrated chili with instant potatoes and dehydrated kale, which ended up being my absolute favorite meal of the trip! Quite a shocker for me, a life-long hater of beans, but what can ya do.</p>
