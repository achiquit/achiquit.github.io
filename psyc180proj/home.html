          <h5 class="main-text-words"><br>Adolescence is an important yet often difficult time in a person’s life. Adolescents are often seen as moody and hormonal, and are no longer viewed by adults as sweet innocent children. You might have seen on mass media such as television that parents are told to prepare for reckless behavior and arguments during their children’s transition into becoming a teenager. I am sure you also may remember times of your personal adolescence that were difficult and confusing to navigate. Here, we will explain the risks of peer pressure during adolescence, why it tends to peak during adolescence, and how social media plays a role.<br><br>As children start to gain more independence, they spend more and more time with their peers and may become more susceptible to peer pressure and influence. As adolescents increase their time spent socializing with their peers, they tend to grow more similar to them in ways that can be simultaneously beneficial and harmful. Students can positively influence their peers through academic motivation and improved performance in school. However, there is also a possibility of increased risk behaviors such as substance abuse and health-related concerns from negative peer influence. Students frequently fall victim to peer pressure because they want to be liked and accepted by their peers and feel included in social settings. Multiple studies have found that a reason for these feelings felt by adolescents may be due to how the adolescent brain develops.<br><br>This behavior may be linked to the pattern of development and maturity in the adolescent brain. The adolescent brain is still developing, and during this time, it tends to have heightened sensitivity in areas that involve reward processing, such as expecting and receiving awards like approval from peers(<a href="citations.html#somerville" target="_blank">Somerville et al., 2010</a>). Increased activity in reward processing areas of the brain is linked to behaviors such as sharing information and receiving positive feedback, which can be activated during social interactions and while using social media. For example, it has been shown that adolescents have greater brain activity in the reward processing region when their own photos received many likes, as compared to few(<a href="citations.html#sherman" target="_blank">Sherman et al., 2018</a>). This increase in activity in the reward processing region of the brain from peer acceptance as shown through ‘likes’ is a possible explanation for an increase in peer pressure and influence during adolescence. Additionally, there is often slower development of the prefrontal cortex, which is the region of the brain that controls impulse and decision making(<a href="citations.html#somerville" target="_blank">Somerville et al., 2010</a>). This lack of control may be another reason that adolescents can be more easily influenced by their peers during this time. If peer acceptance and social rewards cause heightened activity in the reward processing region of the brain, it would be understandable that adolescents would crave this feeling and therefore become susceptible to peer influence.<br><br>Now, we should consider the effect of social media on peer influence. Social media is any social networking site that allows for interactive, user-generated content typically in the form of image or idea sharing(<a href="citations.html#chung" target="_blank">Chung et al., 2021</a>). Social media can provide global methods of influence and persuasion, especially among the adolescent population. Approximately 85% of adolescents between the ages of 12 and 17 within the United States use social media(<a href="citations.html#hur" target="_blank">Hur &#38; Gupta, 2013</a>). Many groups are working to understand adolescents’ susceptibility to peer influence and the effects of social media may have on this developing concern.<br><br>One example of social media influence is the ways in which social media use among adolescent peers can influence their eating behaviors and habits. There are examples of positive peer influence on social media regarding struggling with eating disorders. One study found that young people who are struggling with eating disorders may use online discussion forums as a form of proactive self-care, and they may offer a positive contribution to supporting adolescents with eating disorders(<a href="citations.html#kendal" target="_blank">Kendal et al., 2017</a>). However, there are negative situations as well. A separate study found that some adolescents use blogs to validate a pro-eating disorder lifestyle, share body and image issues, and search for diets and support from others(<a href="citations.html#sofia" target="_blank">Sofia Castro &#38; José Osório, 2013</a>). This is a negative aspect of peer influence on social media. However, while these two findings are conflicting, they both support the same idea that adolescents are very susceptible to peer influence which is amplified and made more accessible through social media.<br><br>Due to the nature of adolescence and brain development, it can be inferred that peer influence and reward-seeking would occur with or without the presence of social media. However, social media does add a new aspect that must be considered. It allows for accessible and constant communication, potentially increasing the availability of being influenced by peers. Social media also allows teens to interact online with people they would not be able to otherwise. This can be both beneficial and harmful depending on the type of influence being provided. This behavior is likely due to the developmental patterns of the adolescent mind, with the early maturity of the reward processing region and the later maturity of the prefrontal cortex. Overall, peer influence appears to be heightened by social media among the adolescent population and should be gently monitored by parents to prevent possible risky scenarios.</h5>
