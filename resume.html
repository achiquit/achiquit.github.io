                    <p>“Andre was able to sell me a new [computer], but he went above and beyond to check out a few other concerns of mine. He also helped me with replacing the battery, I can now use my computer without it being plugged in! Andre also assisted me with purchasing an external hard drive and explained to me how to use it with Apple's Time Machine software to back up my computer in case my antique does eventually die. My mom and I waited in the shop while he checked everything out and in addition to answering all of my random curious questions. Andre and the rest of the staff were warm and friendly!”</p>

                    <p>“Andre went over and beyond for me. My computer died and I was frantic. Not only did he put my worries to ease, but he got my computer done as soon as possible telling me everything that he was doing along the way. I was more than impressed with the customer service.”</p>
                  <h5>5-Star FaceBook Review*</h5>
                    <p>"Andre managed to recover all of my files after my computer crashed and then patiently showed me how to back up my files in case this happens again. Great people and great service. So grateful!”</p>
